## Personal Trainer App - Backend Rails
This is my phase 5 project App. The app allows a Personal Trainer to setup their clients, create exercises and upload photos/videos, generate workout templates and schedule workouts and link to clients and workout templates. 

## Limitations
- Add clients and exercises you cannot upload images/vidoes on new record creation. There needs to be a record to attach to. This needs more work to allow file upload on form submission.  

## Dependancies
- Db is sqlite3
- Active Storage for storing data locally
- Built on ruby 2.6.1p33

## Install Steps
- Download and run bundle install
- Make local server run on port 3001 or change ENV file on front-end to point to your local server address
- add first trainer account to seeds file??
- rails s
